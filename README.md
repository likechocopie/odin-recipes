# odin-recipes
My first TOP project. I'm going to be making a recipe list using the HTML I've learned (but it'll be ugly). But tbf, I've already learned alot. Just to edit this README.md I've had to learn

- creating a github repo
- learning git
- git clone SSH link to my local machine
- code . to open in my VSCode Editor

Not to mention the cool knowledge I've learned about the history of the internet and the WWW.

Once I am complete, I will have demonstrated knowledge of elements suchs as <a href="">, <img src="", alt=""> and the different use cases for <h1-6> and <p>.
